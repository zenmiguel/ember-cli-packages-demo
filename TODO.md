    [x] bundle
    create a Package object that inherits from EmberApp and takes a config override to clean ember-cli-build
    Create an EmberAppWithPackages app that does packages and app and takes overrides for both.
    Expose from addon 
    [x] resolver 
    [x] service:lazy-loader, 
    [x] util:lazy-routing-configuration
    [x] catch-all route,
